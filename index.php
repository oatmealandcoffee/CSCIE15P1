        <p>By day, I am the Director of Publishing Technology at <a href="http://www.jblearning.com" title="Jones &amp;&amp; Bartlett Learning">Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning</a>. I spend most of my time in Xcode (Objective-C mainly), Applescript, and Javascript. At night, I am a degree candidate at <a href="http://www.extension.harvard.edu" title="Harvard University, Extension School">Harvard University, Extension School</a> working towards a Bachelor of Liberal Arts with a concentration in Computer Science. Beyond those, I am a husband and father. <i>In toto</i>, I have no spare time.</p>
        <p>Cheers</p>

    <h3 class="panel-title">Why are you taking this course?
</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    Aside from the obvious "I need the credits for the concentration," the main reason why I am taking this course is because the publishing company where I work is undergoing a significant transition to digital products and workflows. This transition is centered around learning management systems and mobile products, but also web-based content management solutions. My main interest in this course is better learning the full technology stack running these systems.

	What previous experience do you have with programming?
	</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>I started programming in Applesscript in 2005, working through a variety of languages—mainly <a href="https://xojo.com" title="Xojo (formerly REALbasic)">Xojo (formerly REALbasic)</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/cocoa.html" title="Cocoa">Objective-C with the Cocoa frameworks in Xcode</a>—and now primarily <a href="https://creative.adobe.com/products/estk" title="Adobe Extendscript ToolKit for Creative Cloud">Javascript for Adobe Creative Cloud</a>, and whatever Harvard decides to throw at me (which is a lot, suffice to say).</p>
    
    <p>My focus has mainly been on automating a variety of processes related to making books and graphic design: automating page layouts, batch processing images, transforming XML, and other tasks that had really nothing more complex than a dictionary object and the math required to balance a checkbook. My work in the nitty-gritty of computer science didn't happen until I came to school.</p>

  <div class="panel-heading">
    <h3 class="panel-title">
	Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?
	</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    I am on the Mac platform the vast majority of the time, but use Unix/Linux as needed for class and certain low-level tasks at work.

	Anything else we should know?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    I occasionally dabble with <a href="http://www.oatmealandcoffee.com/" title="Oatmeal &amp; Coffee">my own website</a>. Wordpress with some customized CSS, though I figured out the PHP enough to disable all the comments on the blog. Between that and my coursework for <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu" title="CS50">CS50</a>, that's the extent of my PHP experience.
